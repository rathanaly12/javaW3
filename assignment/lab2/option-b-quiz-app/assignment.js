   JavaScript — Week 3 — Lab 2 (Option B) · Quiz App
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   10 multiple-choice questions, Kahoot-style. Add more to the
   question bank if you want — same shape, just add objects.
   After the quiz you get asked to play again.

   Uses: ARRAY of question OBJECTS, FUNCTION (`checkAnswer`,
   `runQuiz`), CALLBACK (`onQuestion` and `onAnswered` — functions
   passed in as parameters that YOU call, without needing to know
   what they do inside — same idea as a forEach callback). What
   they do inside is next week's topic (DOM), already built for
   you, so you can see your functions drive a real page — you
   never write any DOM code here.

   Run: open index.html with Live Server, F12 for the console.

/* =================================================================
   YOUR CODE — Part A: checkAnswer(question, userAnswer)

   Goal: return true if the player's answer matches question.answer
   (ignore extra spaces and UPPER/lowercase differences).

   Two methods you'll need — both work on text (strings):
     .trim()        removes spaces from the start/end.
                     "  b  ".trim()        -> "b"
     .toUpperCase()  converts text to CAPITAL letters.
                     "b".toUpperCase()     -> "B"

   One catch: userAnswer might be null (the player pressed Cancel),
   and calling .trim() on null crashes the whole page. Fix: write
   (userAnswer || "") first — if userAnswer is null, that whole
   expression becomes "" (empty string) instead, which .trim() and
   .toUpperCase() can safely handle.

   Put it together:
     const cleaned = (userAnswer || "").trim().toUpperCase();
     return cleaned === question.answer;
   ================================================================= */
function checkAnswer(question, userAnswer) {
  const cleaned = (userAnswer || "").trim().toUpperCase();
  return cleaned === question.answer;
}

     Hint: put the question + choices INSIDE the prompt message
     itself (as above) — the popup can cover the page, so it needs
     to show everything the player needs, not just "A/B/C".
     Hint: onQuestion/onAnswered are callback parameters, just like
     a forEach callback — call them, you don't need to know what's
     inside them.
